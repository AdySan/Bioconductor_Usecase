The purpose of this project is to compute the GC content of promoters in the yeast genome. 

# Dependencies
library(AnnotationHub)
library(BSgenome)

# Get yeast genome
```{r}
library("BSgenome.Scerevisiae.UCSC.sacCer2")
Scerevisiae
```


# Get promoter ranges of yeast genome

```{r}
ahub = AnnotationHub()
qh = query(ahub, c("sacCer2", "genes"))
qh
genes = ahub[["AH7048"]]
prom = promoters(genes)
# There is warning messages here because G ranges complain when it gets like genome indices that are less than zero. This problem can be solved by trimming promoters
prom = trim(prom)
prom
```

# View the promoter

```{r}
promViews = Views(Scerevisiae, prom)
```


# Get GC content in the promoter and make a density plot

```{r}
gcProm = letterFrequency(promViews, "GC", as.prob = TRUE)
plot(density(gcProm))
abline(v = 0.38)
```
